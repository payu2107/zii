Zii Extension Library for Yii
=============================

Zii is the official extension library for Yii.

USING ZII EXTENSIONS
--------------------

Zii extensions are not auto contained in the PHP include path by default, so 
you must call them using their full path if you wish to use them.  For example,
to use CTimestampBehavior you may use the following in your model:
~~~
[php]
	    public function behaviors()
	    {
	            return array(
	                    'CTimestampbehavior' => array(
	                            'class' => 'zii.behaviors.CTimestampbehavior',
	                    )
	            );
	    }
~~~
